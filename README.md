# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program

This repository contains most of my projects submissions 
and exercises answers for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program.

* `temporal_difference/` contains implementations of the SARSA, SARSAMAX and Expected-SARSA algorithm 
  to solve Sutton's cliff-walking environment.
  
* `taxi/` solves the 'Taxi-v3' environment. The agent obtains a best average reward of 8.83,
  putting it 6th on the [leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#taxi-v3).
  
* `lunar_lander/` solves the 'LunarLander-v2' environment in 600 episodes (6th on the
  [leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#lunarlander-v2)).
  
* `navigation/` is my submission for the Banana Unity ML environment (modified version by Udacity). 
The agent solves the game in ~350 episodes.
